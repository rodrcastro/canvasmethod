# The Canvas Method for Information Security

Use the Canvas Method for Information Security to increase risk awareness and ownership throughout the organization. 

The 4 canvases are designed to be used in a workshop setting, to implement a continuous and structured dialogue about risk sources, risks, controls, incidents and improvements. 

The Canvas Method is especially valuable for organizational units where affinity with information technology is typically low. Using the method will improve understanding of cybersecurity risk and controls management amongst non-technical personnel, and help them identify areas where they can and should take responsibility themselves.
